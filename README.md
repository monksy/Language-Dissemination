Language-Dissemination
======================

The goal of this agent based system is to attempt to model language communication and migration.


**Technologies Used:** NetLogo, Agents, Modeling Environments, Complex Systems

**Purpose:** Final Project for Masters Level Complex Systems Class

**Keywords:** Computer Simulation, Complex Systems, Languages, Populations, Environments, Agents

This project is to create a simulation of a complex environment and complex set of behaviors. This system attempts to model the following variables: lifespan, fertility rate, movement obsticals, magical transplanting (flying to a geographically disconntected region), and concentration. This system creates a simulation the allows each agent to follow a predefined set of rules inorder to show how a set of languages may dessiminate from one location/group to another. NetLogo was used due to its focus and existing functionality for creating agent based systems. 

The environment, in which the agents live in, is composed of two different states. One state is water, which the agents cannot cross. The second state of the environment is land. Agents may travel freely on land. Throughout the simulation the area of the land and water remain the same. Before starting the simulation the user may prompt the number of islands that he or she may like. Typically, with an increase amount of islands many of the islands start bridging together and form large continents. The agents have no affect on the environment, nor does the environment limit the production of the agents.
